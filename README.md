# Recruitment Exercise

https://github.com/buildit/org-design/blob/master/Recruitment/Exercises/js_engineer_contract.md

> build a React app displaying the 5 day weather forecast for a location of your choice.

Here is the [Starter kit](https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-bootstrap-webpack-starter) I used, found by searching for '[react webpack es6 sass hot](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=react+webpack+es6+sass+hot&type=Repositories&ref=searchresults)' on github.

### Demo
http://norgeous.github.io/recruitment-exercise/

The build should also work just by opening `docs/index.html` in your browser.

### Download / Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/norgeous/recruitment-exercise.git
cd recruitment-exercise
npm i
```

### Run / Build / Test
Please refer to https://github.com/MacKentoch/react-bootstrap-webpack-starter

NOTE: There are different commands for **Windows users**.

### Todo
> Anything you might implement with more time (features, fixes, technical debt corrections etc)

* Improve the colour scheme.
* Better weather icons, such as https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/
* Improve the layout, such as a carousel.
* Improve the responsiveness (currently just flexbox), add some media queries or bootstrap.
* Automatically reloading the API results.
* Caching results from the API.
* Retry requests on API fail.
* Could include more info than just time and icon.
* Proper testing / code coverage.
* Testing the build system on different platforms.
* Checking that the build runs in different browsers / check caniuse.com for a few things.
